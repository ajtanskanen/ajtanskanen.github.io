Hi! I'm Antti. While I work at the confederation of Finnish industries EK, this is my personal site that contains things I find interesting.
I like to entertain the idea that I am quite knowledgeable about pensions and social security. Less professionally, I 
find applications of AI and applicable math quite interesteting. This, I think, reflects in my blog posts. 


Background
=====
My background is in science and in insurance. My PhD is in mathematics, however, it mostly consider modeling left vertricular cardiac myocytes. 
Then, I moved to modeling insurance things (see, Publications). Currently, my scientific interests are mostly in applying reinforced learning to
life cycle models. 


This site
=====
This is my personal blog. I mostly put here long, technical musings about things I work on, kinda like working papers. 
Most of the writings are in Finnish, but I may occasionally put in something in English, too. Don't hold your breath, though.

Contact
=====
Should you have any comments or questions on my musings, or even corrections on them, I am more than happy to <a href="email:antti.tanskanen@iki.fi">receive them!</a>
