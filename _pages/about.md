Hey there! I'm Antti. This is my personal site that contains things I find interesting. Please see [blog posts](/year-archive) that
contains various ramblings about topics that I find interesting. I hope to find time to write more: there are always lots of interesting
things going on. You are welcome to contact me by [email or by twitter](/contact/).

I mostly put here long, technical [musings](/year-archive) about things I work on, kinda like working papers. 
Most of the [writings](/year-archive) are in Finnish, but I occasionally write something in English, too. Don't hold your breath, though.

Background & work
=====
My background is in science and in insurance. My [PhD](/publication/2008-05-05-phd) is in mathematics, however, it mostly consider 
modeling left vertricular cardiac myocytes. 
Then, I moved to modeling insurance things (see, [Publications](/publications)). 
Currently, I am quite interested in applying reinforced learning to life cycle models. More on that in [Publications](/publications).

This is my personal site and does not have any connection to my employer.

Contact
=====
Should you have any comments or questions on my musings, or even corrections on them, I am more than happy to <a href="email:antti.tanskanen@iki.fi">receive them!</a>
