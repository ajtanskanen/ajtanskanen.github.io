Hi! I'm Antti. While I work at the confederation of Finnish industries EK, this is my personal site that contains things I find interesting.
My background is in science and in insurance. I like entertain the idea that I am quite knowledgeable about pensions and social security. Less preofessionally, I 
find applications of AI and applicable math quite interesteting. This, I think, reflects in my blog posts.
