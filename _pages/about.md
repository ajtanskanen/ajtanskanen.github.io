Hi! I'm Antti. This is my personal site that contains things I find interesting. Less professionally, I 
find applications of AI and applicable math quite interesteting. This, I think, reflects in my blog posts. 


Background
=====
My background is in science and in insurance. My [PhD](/publication/2008-05-05-phd) is in mathematics, however, it mostly consider 
modeling left vertricular cardiac myocytes. 
Then, I moved to modeling insurance things (see, [Publications](/publications)). 
Currently, I am quite interested in applying reinforced learning to life cycle models. 

Work
=====
While I work at the confederation of Finnish industries EK, this is my personal site and does not have any connection to my employer.
At work, I like to entertain the idea that I am quite knowledgeable about pensions and social security.


This site
=====
This is my personal blog. I mostly put here long, technical musings about things I work on, kinda like working papers. 
Most of the writings are in Finnish, but I may occasionally put in something in English, too. Don't hold your breath, though.

Contact
=====
Should you have any comments or questions on my musings, or even corrections on them, I am more than happy to <a href="email:antti.tanskanen@iki.fi">receive them!</a>
